## [256. Paint House (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house "粉刷房子")

<p>There are a row of <i>n</i> houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.</p>

<p>The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a <code><i>n</i> x <i>3</i></code> cost matrix. For example, <code>costs[0][0]</code> is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; <code>costs[1][2]</code> is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
All costs are positive integers.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 10
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. 
&nbsp;            Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
